&lt;p>The actor concurrency model is a conceptual model where an actor represents the primitive unit of computation.
An Actor has 3 responsibilities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Communication&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Storage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Processing&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="communication">Communication&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A single actor on its own makes no sense. Actors come in systems and communicate with each other using mailboxes. Each actor is associated with an address and everything in the system would be modeled using actors.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="storage">Storage&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>An actor can have a private internal state. Each actor is completely isolated from each other since no actor can access the state of another. They can only communicate using messages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cleaner flows with Pattern Matching in Elixir</title><link>https://rizasal.github.io/posts/2022-05-19-pattern-match/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rizasal.github.io/posts/2022-05-19-pattern-match/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pattern matching is a powerful feature of most Functional Programming languages and allows for a huge improvement in readability.
At it&amp;rsquo;s core, pattern match in Elixir relies on the match operator, the = sign. It tries to match the right hand side with the left hand side.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What difference would this have with the == or the === sign that many other languages have?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The match operator allows you to bind variables in addition to checking for a match. Let&amp;rsquo;s understand this through an example&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
