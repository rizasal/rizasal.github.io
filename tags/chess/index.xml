Especially if it is to be online and multiplayer.
It is not feasible to send the entire board object around and we need a way to send individual piece movements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the ways to do that is the Forsynth-Edwards Notation aka FEN string. A beautiful way to represent the board in a one line ASCII string. It is widely used to record chess games and start from different initial positions
or even the middle of a game.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
